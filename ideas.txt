1. for objects
    . make class of diff objects, with class.draw() for drawing,
      class.rotate(), etc
        eg( 
          cube:
            centre = ..
            side = ..
            coords = (in terms of centre and side. so that changing centre translates the cube)
            // if coords not like above, we can try translate() or just 4 by 4 matrix in rotate()
          )
        


.  remember to
    . change the printing method, so that points outside the screen dont crash the program
    . change board to [][]
    . change printing to something smarter
    . try: big scrDist and objects within that and origin(closer to screen)
    . try: 1/(z-scrDist) and scrDist/(z+scrDist) in projectP
